# uses a colon as the separator and these values contain colons.

# javax.servlet:servlet-api comes from core at version 0, which is an intentional trick to
# prevent this library from being used, and we do not want it to be upgraded to a nonzero
# version (which is not a realistic test scenario) just because it happens to be on the
# class path of some plugin and triggers an upper bounds violation. JENKINS-68696 tracks the
# removal of this trick.
